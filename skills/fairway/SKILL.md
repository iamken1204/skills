description: Implement with happy-path-first orchestration, deep modules, type-driven invariants, and evidence-gated complexity. Use when building or refactoring a feature whose main flow should read plainly, or when code buries its happy path under ceremony and defensive branches.
---

Keep the reader on the fairway: the happy path is the main line of the code, mechanics live in deep modules below it, and complexity is added only on evidence.

The happy path should dominate what readers see, in proportion to how much of real behavior it is. That is a bias for layout and emphasis, not a license to skip error handling: failures still get code, below or beside the main line, in proportion to their reality.

Start with context:

- inspect the existing code, callsites, data flow, and nearby conventions
- understand the real use case before choosing abstractions
- preserve good repository patterns; do not impose a generic architecture

Examples below are TypeScript; the rules are language-neutral (see the note under Type-Driven Invariants).

## Tie-Breakers

The rules in this skill pull in two directions: types and boundaries add structure, rent and evidence remove it. When they conflict, decide in this order:

1. **Safety first.** Security boundaries, concurrency primitives, and irreversible data operations (deletes, payments, migrations) may be defended without runtime evidence. Everything else needs proof.
2. **Default to the smallest honest implementation**: a direct function, a Transaction Script, a vertical slice.
3. **Promote a raw value to a domain type** only when it crosses a trust boundary or carries an invariant more than one place must respect. Inside a small local scope, a well-named variable is enough.
4. **Extract a module, port, or service** only when it hides real complexity, owns a real invariant, or has more than one real implementation.
5. **Remove duplication at the third occurrence**, when the shared shape is proven (Rule of Three). Duplication is cheaper than the wrong abstraction.

## Happy-Path-First Orchestration

Top-level methods coordinate a use case by calling well-named domain operations. They should not contain parsing, process plumbing, protocol details, state surgery, or long validation branches.

DON'T make the orchestrator own every detail:

```ts
async function update(input: string) {
  if (!input) throw new Error("missing version")
  const child = spawn("sh", ["-c", buildInstallScript(input)])
  const result = await collectOutput(child)
  if (result.code !== 0) throw new Error(result.stderr)
  const installed = parseVersion(await runVersionCommand())
  if (installed !== input) throw new Error("wrong version")
  await killExistingProcess()
  await startProcess()
}
```

DO expose the use case and push mechanics behind deep boundaries:

```ts
async function update(version: Version) {
  await server.stop()
  await cli.install(version)
  await cli.requireVersion(version)
  await server.start()
}
```

## Guards, Not Nesting

- reject invalid conditions with early guards; keep the valid path flat and linear, never nested inside defensive branches
- return early for a legal no-op: "nothing to do" is a valid outcome
- assert or throw for a broken invariant: a state that should be impossible must fail loudly, never be silently swallowed
- let errors reach the existing user-facing boundary unless recovery is an explicit product requirement
- handle common operational failures clearly; an uncommon case gets code only after concrete runtime evidence

DON'T bury the valid path in nested conditionals:

```ts
if (config) {
  if (config.enabled) {
    if (server.ready) {
      return run(config)
    }
  }
}
return undefined
```

DO leave invalid conditions first and keep the valid path flat:

```ts
if (!config) return            // legal no-op
if (!config.enabled) return    // legal no-op
assert(server.ready)           // broken invariant: fail loudly
return run(config)
```

## Deep Modules, Deliberate Interfaces

- names describe domain intent, not implementation mechanics
- required dependencies are explicit and impossible to omit
- prefer small cohesive interfaces over bags of callbacks, booleans, and optional behavior switches
- keep IO in infrastructure; keep domain decisions out of wrappers
- extract one deep operation that hides real complexity; do not shatter a flow into shallow helper shrapnel

DON'T force readers to reconstruct one operation from fragments:

```ts
prepareUpdate()
doUpdate()
finishUpdate()
```

DO keep tightly related code together, or extract one deep operation:

```ts
await cli.installExactVersion(version)
```

State and its invariants have one owner. Tell the owner the domain operation instead of reading its state and mutating it from outside.

DON'T:

```ts
if (session.status() === "pending") {
  session.messages().push(message)
  session.setStatus("active")
}
```

DO:

```ts
session.promote(message)
```

## Type-Driven Invariants

- make invalid states unrepresentable where the language can express it
- parse external, persisted, and network data once at the boundary; internal code receives trusted values and never re-checks raw data
- use domain types for meaningful IDs, versions, paths, states, and results; no `any`, loose string protocols, or nullable states where a precise type can express the contract
- enforce invariants in constructors, schemas, and narrow signatures, so illegal combinations cannot be constructed, not merely documented
- make required state explicit in parameters instead of reading optional ambient state deep in the flow

DON'T validate raw values and throw away what the check proved:

```ts
validateVersion(input)
await install(input) // still a raw string
```

DO parse into a trusted domain value once:

```ts
const version = Version.parse(input)
await install(version)
```

DON'T represent mutually exclusive states with nullable fields and booleans:

```ts
type Server = {
  starting: boolean
  url?: string
  error?: string
}
```

DO model the legal states directly:

```ts
type ServerState =
  | { kind: "stopped" }
  | { kind: "starting" }
  | { kind: "ready"; url: ServerUrl }
  | { kind: "failed"; error: ServerError }
```

**Language note.** In languages with weak or no static types (bash, untyped Python, plain JS), keep the same discipline without the ceremony: validate once at the entry point, fail fast there, and let names carry the trusted form downstream. Where sum types are missing (Go), prefer the clearest native encoding over an emulated one. Do not simulate a type system with wrappers the language cannot enforce; that is ceremony without the guarantee.

## Patterns Must Pay Rent

Patterns, layers, abstractions, interfaces, and files are costs. Use one only when it buys more readability, correctness, testing, or change-isolation than it costs in lines, files, call hops, and concepts a reader must learn.

- a pattern name is vocabulary for a design that emerged, not a requirement to manufacture that design
- an abstraction that moves ten obvious lines into five files is negative value
- a repository that only renames one database call is a shallow module, not architecture
- do not build `Controller -> Service -> Repository` chains because a diagram, framework, or blog post says they should exist
- Screaming Architecture means the code reveals its use cases, not that it has layers: `invoice/pay.ts` screams louder than three folders of pass-through methods

DON'T apply a repository pattern to ten obvious lines:

```ts
class UserController {
  constructor(private service: UserService) {}
  get(id: string) {
    return this.service.get(id)
  }
}

class UserService {
  constructor(private repository: UserRepository) {}
  get(id: string) {
    return this.repository.get(id)
  }
}

class UserRepository {
  get(id: string) {
    return database.selectUser(id)
  }
}
```

DO keep a simple use case simple:

```ts
async function getUser(id: UserID) {
  return database.selectUser(id)
}
```

Add the repository later, when data access becomes a real domain port or hides stable complexity that callers should not know.

## Evidence Before Complexity

- prefer one obvious path and one source of truth
- outside the safety carve-out in Tie-Breakers, do not defend against theoretical edge cases: wait until a runtime, log, test reproduction, persisted state, or user report proves the case exists
- when evidence arrives, fix the smallest real failure at the boundary that owns it; do not build a general defense system around one incident
- never justify complexity with "could", "might", or "what if" alone; state the observed failure and its likelihood
- when editing existing code, a safeguard you cannot trace to evidence is a question to raise, not a line to silently delete
- prefer less code, fewer names, fewer branches, and net-negative diffs when behavior permits

DON'T add lifecycle machinery for an imagined race:

```ts
const attempts = new Map<ID, number>()
// counters, stale ownership checks, retries, cleanup, and fallback paths
// added because two calls might theoretically overlap
```

DO implement the observed flow directly:

```ts
await stopServer(id)
await installCli(version)
await startServer(id)
```

When a real runtime later reports `Text file busy`, use that evidence to add the smallest owned fix: make `stopServer` await process exit before installation. Do not build a lifecycle framework.

## Domain Core, Infrastructure Shell

DON'T leak infrastructure into domain decisions:

```ts
function promote(message: Message) {
  spawn("sh", ["-c", notifyScript])
  database.insert(message)
}
```

DO keep domain decisions in the core and IO in ports, adapters, or the imperative shell:

```ts
const event = session.promote(message)
await sessionStore.append(event)
```

## Tests At Stable Boundaries

Tests prove behavior through real boundaries. Do not test one-line helpers, duplicate implementation logic, or build large mock systems for small changes.

DON'T test the implementation sentence by sentence:

```ts
expect(regionFor("eu-1")).toBe("region:eu-1")
expect(shouldRestart({ available: false })).toBe(true)
```

DO test the stable use-case boundary and observable order:

```ts
await controller.update("1.2.3")
expect(events).toEqual(["stop", "install", "verify", "start"])
```

## Vocabulary

Name the design that emerged with established terminology:

| Desired quality | Established terminology |
| --- | --- |
| Main flow reads like the use case | Composed Method, use-case orchestration |
| Mechanics hidden below small interfaces | Deep modules, information hiding, complexity pulled downward |
| Domain logic free of process and network code | Functional Core / Imperative Shell, Ports and Adapters |
| Smallest honest implementation of one use case | Transaction Script, vertical slice |
| Boundary checks produce trusted values | Parse Don't Validate, smart constructors |
| Types enforce invariants | Making illegal states unrepresentable, type-driven design |
| Invalid conditions leave before the normal flow | Guard clauses, fail-fast |
| Reuse follows real repetition | Rule of Three, semantic compression, YAGNI |
| State and behavior have one owner | Encapsulation, Tell Don't Ask |

## Done

Finish the complete change, run focused verification, delete temporary artifacts, and make one final simplification pass. The result should feel boring, obvious, cohesive, and native to the codebase; in typed languages, also typed.

The combined style is: **happy-path-first, use-case-oriented design with deep modules, type-driven invariants, boundary isolation, and evidence-driven complexity.**
